# RGH Achievement & Avatar Award Unlocker - WPF
- Early concept
- Includes a VERY basic splash screen/progress indicator similar to devexpress
- Refer to this for more info about the code behind and how it works https://github.com/XeCrippy/AchievementUnlocker
- Saves addresses to a json file along with it's corresponding title ID. It can then be used to avoid having to search the xex for the function each time. This can get messy because it currently doesn't handle different Titile Updates or games with multiple xex's (like Call of Duty games).
